Strands Agents:

1.0 Introduction :

  Strands Agents is an open-source Software Development Kit (SDK) designed for the simplified creation and deployment of AI agents. 
  It utilizes a model-driven approach, which leverages the inherent reasoning and planning capabilities of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) to 
  direct an agent's actions, moving away from complex, pre-defined orchestration logic.

2.0 Core Concepts & Architecture :

  The framework is built on several key principles to make agent development more intuitive and efficient.
  
  2.1 The Model-Driven Approach: Instead of developers coding rigid workflows, Strands empowers the LLM itself to plan steps, chain thoughts, call tools, and reflect. This reduces development time and shifts focus from orchestration code to the model's capabilities.
  
  2.2 Fundamental Components: Every Strands agent consists of three primary components:
  
  Model: The core LLM that provides reasoning. Strands is model-agnostic, supporting providers like Amazon Bedrock, Anthropic, Meta Llama, and Ollama.
  
  Tools: The functions and APIs an agent uses to act. Tools are the primary method for customizing agent capabilities and can be created from any Python function via the     @tool decorator.
  
  Prompt: The instructions for the agent, including both the end-user's task and a system prompt that defines the agent's overall behavior and constraints.

Agentic Loop :
  What is the Agentic Loop?
    The Agentic Loop is the main process an AI agent uses to think and act to solve a problem. 
    Think of it as the AI's step-by-step "thinking cycle."

The Steps of the AGentic Loop :

Step 1: Get the Goal

The loop begins when you give the agent a task.

Step 2: Think and Plan

The agent's brain (the model) looks at the goal and all the tools it has. 
It then thinks and decides on the best first action to take.

Step 3: Take Action (Use a Tool)

The agent executes the action it just planned.

Step 4: See the Result & Observe

The agent gets new information back from its action.

Step 5: Repeat the Cycle

Now, the loop starts over again from Step 2. The agent uses the new information to think and plan its next action.

This "Think -> Act -> Observe -> Think Again" cycle continues until the main goal is finally achieved and the case is solved.
